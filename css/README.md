# Custom CSS themes for AniList

I keep record of all used CSS for my AniList profile. If you decide to use big chunks of code, don't forget to credit me. Thanks.
(You don't really have to leave credit unless you copy entire classes, though)

## List of CSS
- [`2020.css`](https://github.com/dizzyatlovich/AL-css/blob/main/css/2020.css) - My initial CSS and the one I've used throughout 2020.
- [`2021.css`](https://github.com/dizzyatlovich/AL-css/blob/main/css/2021.css) - April 2021 CSS rework. Largely inspired by my other project - [Zenbu](https://zenbu.moe)
